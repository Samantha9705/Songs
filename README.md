Write SQL queries to answer questions about a database of songs.

Provided to you is a file called songs.db, a SQLite database that stores data from Spotify about songs and their artists. This dataset contains the top 100 streamed songs on Spotify in 2018. In a terminal window, run sqlite3 songs.db so that you can begin executing queries on the database.

Every artist has an id and a name. Notice, too, that every song has a name, an artist_id (corresponding to the id of the artist of the song), as well as values for the danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness (presence of spoken words in a track), valence, tempo, and duration of the song (measured in milliseconds).

The challenge ahead of you is to write SQL queries to answer a variety of different questions by selecting data from one or more of these tables. After you do so, you’ll reflect on the ways Spotify might use this same data in their annual Spotify Wrapped campaign to characterize listeners’ habits.
