If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura? he likes the global music but love pop music

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose? We can tae in count the genre, with this we have a broad overview although we can consider the time he spend listen music an make a query for that
